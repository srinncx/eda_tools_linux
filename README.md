# EDA Tools for Linux

This repository contains **instructions** and **scripts** to install and configure a set of popular open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools on Linux systems (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian).
Work is in progress — contributions and improvements are welcome!

## ✅ What This Has

This project aims to help you install and set up the following EDA tools:

* **xschem** — schematic capture
* **Yosys** — RTL synthesis tool
* **Icarus Verilog** — Verilog simulation
* **ngspice** — SPICE analog simulator
* **SkyWater PDK** — Process Design Kit for open-source silicon
* …and many more

> The scripts are designed to automate download, build, and install steps needed to use these tools on a Linux system.

## 📦 Contents

At the moment, the repository contains basic installation steps in text form:

* `eda_tools_download.txt` — instructions/scripts for downloading and installing multiple EDA tools
* `open_pdks_install.txt` — instructions for installing open-source PDKs (like SkyWater 130nm)

These are work-in-progress and will be expanded over time.
